# RL-base

This is collection of RL baseline algorithms and hand-picked papers across different RL topics I am trying to understand better or just implement for fun.

Most of the papers I have chosen to try and implement are from the Spinning up Key papers in deep RL list


## Setup

**Install dependencies**

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Install the package**
```
    $ pip install -e .
```


Most implementations are standalone and can be run by executing the `main` file as a script. See each implemention's directory in `rlbase/` for further details.
